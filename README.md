# ULD Packing

The repository implements 3-D bin packing into multiple bins keeping constraints of weight-limit and other important constraints of stability,etc.

## How to Run:

### Install the reuired python packages

```bash
$ pip install matplotlib streamlit numpy
```

#### Use the main.py to run the code

In the main function change the file path of the input file and simply run

```bash
$ python main.py
```
This gives the output on the output file with every package id having the uld_id it has been assigned and the coordinated of its begining and the opposite corner in a comma seperated format

Visualizations for each ULD are also generated by using the matplotlib library
