For the challenge problem, we have 6 ULDs available and 400 packages that need
to be loaded.

K = 5000, i.e. cost of spreading Priority Packages in multiple ULDs is 5000 x
(number of ULDs that have Priority Packages).

ULD attributes (comma separated values) are as follows:
ULD Identifier,Length (cm),Width (cm),Height (cm),Weight Limit (kg)
U1,224,318,162,2500

Package attributes (comma separated values) are as follows:
Package Identifier,Length (cm),Width (cm),Height (cm),Weight (kg),Type (P/E),Cost of Delay
